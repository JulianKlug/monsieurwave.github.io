> 𝗢𝘂𝗿 𝗵𝘆𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝘀: the brain becomes more resilient to a second stroke after a first attack

![Resilience](/images/stroke_resilience/resilience_def.png "Resilience")

𝗣𝗼𝗽𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: 
- 16 patients with an initial lesion restricted to M1 and full recovery at 1 month
- 16 healthy controls

--> All patients had a fMRI scan at 3 timepoints (2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after stroke)

𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: simulation of clinically representative secondary lesions on the obtained functional networks

𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘀: after full clinical recovery, the networks of patients having sustained a stroke 3 months beforehand were more resilient to a secondary attack
