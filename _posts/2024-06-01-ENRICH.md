### Clinical question

In patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), does early minimally invasive surgical removal reduce the risk of death or severe disability as compared to medical management?


### Pathophysiological considerations 

_Hematoma expansion_
- Hematoma expansion is a major determinant of outcome in ICH
- Most hematoma expansion occurs within 3 hours of onset
- Hypertension is a major risk factor for hematoma expansion

_Edema and inflammation_
- secondary injury is driven by edema (both focal and global), inflammation and oxidative stress

_ICP elevation_
- both hematoma volume and edema contribute to ICP elevation

## Prior evidence 

Standard evacuation
* STICH-I 2005 -- n=1033 (UK), all supratentorial, < 72h, evacuation vs. conservative, overall no benefit, potential benefit in superficial ICH (< 1cm from surface)
* STICH-II 2013 -- n=601 (Worldwide), superficial, <48h, evacuation vs. conservative, overall no benefit, potential benefit in <21h 
  * max 100ml and no intraventricular hemorrhage

Minimal invasive evacuation
* MISTIE-III, 2019 -- n=506 (Worldwide), non-growing supratentorial, <72h, minimally invasive vs. conservative, overall no benefit, potential survival benefit 
  * acute bleeding excluded, insufficient clot evacuation

AHA 2022 guidelines
- Class IIb recommendation for minimally invasive surgery for ICH evacuation for reduction of mortality

_Main critiques of prior trials:_
* early trials (STICH-I / II) too destructive
* interventions too late
* volume of evacuation too small

## ENRICH trial
### Population

_Patient inclusion criteria_
- 18-80y
- Spontaneous supratentorial ICH
- hematoma volume 30-80ml on CT
- GCS 5-14, NIHSS > 5
- prior mRS 0-1
- surgery possible within 24h of las known well

_Patient exclusion criteria_
- long-term anticoagulation
- uncorrectable coagulopathy
- _very poor or very good_ neurological examination
- infratentorial & thalamic ICH
- intraventricular hemorrhage > 50% of lateral ventricle

Screening: 
All ICH

Goal: 
- early intervention (< 24h)
- active bleeding not an exclusion criteria

### Trial design

Design: open label, parallel group, superiority randomized controlled adaptive trial

Period: 2016-2022
Location: US, 37 centers
Two subgroups: lobar and anterior basal ganglia

Randomisation: 1:1
Adaptive design:
- interim analyis planned at 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, and 275 patients
- possible adaptive decisions: stop in either the anterior basal ganglia or the lobar location, stop for all, or continue for all

### Intervention

craniotomy, imaging-guided trajectory w/ BrainPath port, Suction evacuation

Comments:
- planning for white matter tract preservation (Software by Nico corporation)

### Outcomes

_Primary outcome_: utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 6 months

_Main secondary outcomes_: 
- significant post-operative rebleeding (>+ 4 pts on NIHSS or -2pts on GCS)
- Length of stay
- mRS at 7 days / discharge / 30 days / 90 days
- survival at 6 months

_Safety Outcomes_: 
- death at 30 days
- change in hematoma volume

_Assessment_: 
- audio-recorded structured interview at 30, 90, and 180 days
- assessment of outcome by blinded neuropsychologist

### Results
#### Trial conduct

_Recruitment:_ 37 sites, 300 patients, 6 years
- highly selected population, **_only 2.5%_** of screened patients included
- lost to follow-up: 5%

Adaptation triggerred: After 175 patients, the trial was stopped for the anterior basal ganglia location

_Population:_
- globally well-balanced among groups
- representative of Western ICH population
- only 20% of prior mRS =< 1 ?? (seems like an error in Table 1, as the inclusion criteria was mRS 0-1)

_Intervention:_ 
- median time to surgery: 16.7h  
- remaining hematoma volume: 15ml

#### Outcomes

_Primary outcome_: significant difference in utility weighted mRS at 6 months (0.45 vs 0.37, posterior probability of superiority 0.98)
- mainly driven by the lobar subgroup (0.51 vs 0.37)
- no effect in the anterior basal ganglia subgroup (0.34 vs 0.37)

_Secondary outcomes_: 
- Distribution of mRs shift: evenly distributed over all categories (not only increase in survival)
- globally all secondary outcomes were in favor of the intervention, notably:
  - reduced ICU and hospital length of stay
  - reduced time on the ventilator
  - less salvage craniectomy (3% vs 20%)
- Difference in mRs =< 3 and mortality with numerical benefit for intervention, but not significant
  - this could be mainly driven by a lack of power (trial was designed to detect change of overall shift, not individual categories of mRS) 

_Subgroups_: 
- Main benefit in: patients >= 65y, lobar location, GCS 9-14 (and more benefit in women?)

_Safety outcomes_: 
- globally less adverse events in the intervention group
- notably fewer pneumonia (although number of respiratory failure events was similar), less cerebral edema and less secondary ICH

### Assessment

_Weaknesses_
- Highly selected population: only 2.5% of screened patients included (this was confirmed by recent feasibility exploration in Sweden[^2])
- Single technique: other minimally invasive techniques were not explored (SCUBA endoscopic techniques are also currently developed) 
  - Not clear if the benefit is from the instruments or the guidance provided by the software 
  - The trial was sponsored by Nico corporation - although no interference was reported, the potential for bias is present
- Generalisation outside US? although the authors show that a variety of centers were included (and the brain port could be mimicked by a 50cc seringue), the generalisation to other countries is not clear
- «minimally» invasive: the brain port is still of significant size 
- Primary bayesian analysis, making interpretation and back-checking of statistics more difficult
  - design and statistics was outsourced to a statistics company 
- Medium size trial (300 patients)

<p></p>
_Strengths_
- First ever positive trial for supratentorial ICH 
- Extremely well-designed RCT
- Blinding was done as much as possible

_Interpretation_
- effect on outcomes is clinically significant (seems to be not only driven by survival at the expense of severe disability) 
- the benefit is mainly driven by the lobar subgroup 
- in the anterior basal ganglia subgroup, no conclusion can be drawn

_Bottomline_: 
In patients with lobar ICH, minimally invasive surgery within 24h of onset improves outcome at 6 months. 

_Open questions_:
- is the benefit driven by the planning software or the technique?
- is this small population worth the investment in the technique?
