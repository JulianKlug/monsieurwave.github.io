Physiological evidence suggests that perfusion characteristics (vascular supply, collateral blood flow) of neighbouring brain regions can be highly correlated. We investigated whether integrating perfusion information from the area surrounding a given voxel (i.e. the receptive field) improves the prediction of infarction of this voxel.
