I am a MD candidate at the University of Geneva working with [Emmanuel Carrera (Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève)](http://www.carreralab.com/) and the [MIP-lab headed by Prof. Dimitri Van De Ville (EPFL)](https://miplab.epfl.ch/). My research centers on biomedical applications of machine learning, with a special focus on medical imaging in acute ischemic stroke.

In addition to my research, I am very involved in the design of new tools to enhance the care for patients. Currently, I am working on [PHI](https://www.phinterface.com/), a tool aiming to connect patients to their hospital caregivers before and after their stay. In the past, I also had a hand in peer-to-peer communication networks whilst running Vlynt.
