I am a MD working with [Emmanuel Carrera (Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève)](http://www.carreralab.com/) and the [MIP-lab headed by Prof. Dimitri Van De Ville (EPFL)](https://miplab.epfl.ch/). My research centers on biomedical applications of machine learning, with a special focus on medical imaging in acute ischemic stroke.

In addition to my research, I love designing practical tools to enhance the care for patients and enjoy contributing to open-source projects. I have worked on [PHI](https://www.phinterface.com/), a tool aiming to connect patients to their hospital caregivers before and after their stay and had a hand in peer-to-peer communication networks whilst running Vlynt.  

For a more formal account of my academic work, see my Curriculum Vitae or Google Scholar.
