I am a MD working with [Emmanuel Carrera (Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève)](http://www.carreralab.com/) and the [MIP-lab headed by Prof. Dimitri Van De Ville (EPFL)](https://miplab.epfl.ch/). My research centers on biomedical applications of machine learning, with a special focus on medical imaging in acute ischemic stroke.

In addition to my research, I love designing practical tools to enhance the care for patients and enjoy contributing to open-source projects. I am currently working on [Kassandra](https://kassandra.julianklug.com), a tool to bring machine learning tools into my clinical practice. I have worked on [PHI](https://www.creageneve.com/2020/02/14/prix-une-team-qui-innove/), a tool aiming to connect patients to their hospital caregivers before and after their stay and had a hand in peer-to-peer communication networks whilst running Vlynt.  

For a more formal account of my academic work, see my [Curriculum Vitae](https://www.julianklug.com/files/cv_julian_klug.pdf) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uvlWXnAAAAAJ&hl=en).

Non-Academic Projects: 
- [Kassandra](https://kassandra.julianklug.com), bringing machine learning safely to clinical practice
- [FentaSim](http://fentasim.julianklug.com), a tool to simulate effect site concentrations of fentanyl
- [PHI](https://www.creageneve.com/2020/02/14/prix-une-team-qui-innove/), connect patients to their hospital 
- Vlynt, a peer-to-peer content delivery network
- I try to help out with great open-source projects, such as [nibabel](https://github.com/nipy/nibabel/commits?author=JulianKlug) and created some open-source tools such as [RandAugment3D](https://github.com/JulianKlug/RandAugment-3D)
