I am a critical care fellow currently training in the Lausanne University Hospital and working in the [Geneva Stroke Lab](https://www.carreralab.com/) led by Prof. Emmanuel Carrera (Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève). Previously, I had the opportunity to learn and work at the [MIP-lab](https://miplab.epfl.ch/) headed by Prof. Dimitri Van De Ville (EPFL) and the [Lee Lab](https://oto.hms.harvard.edu/people/daniel-lee) directed by Dr. Daniel Lee (Harvard, MEEI). My research centers on biomedical applications of machine learning, with a special focus on acute ischemic stroke.

In addition to my clinical work and research, I love designing practical tools to enhance the care for patients and enjoy contributing to open-source projects. I am currently working on [Kassandra](https://kassandra.julianklug.com), a tool to bring machine learning into my clinical practice. I have worked on PHI, a tool aiming to connect patients to their hospital caregivers before and after their stay and had a hand in peer-to-peer communication networks whilst running Vlynt.  

For a more formal account of my academic work, see my [Curriculum Vitae](https://www.julianklug.com/files/cv_julian_klug.pdf) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uvlWXnAAAAAJ&hl=en).

Non-Academic Projects: 
- [Kassandra](https://kassandra.julianklug.com), bringing machine learning safely to clinical practice
- [FentaSim](http://fentasim.julianklug.com), a tool to simulate effect site concentrations of fentanyl
- [DD4PcPH](http://eddy.zapto.org:2086/), a tool to help choosing the right measure of cardiac output for the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension
- PHI, connect patients to their hospital 
- Vlynt, a peer-to-peer content delivery network
- I try to help out with great open-source projects, such as [nibabel](https://github.com/nipy/nibabel/commits?author=JulianKlug) and created some open-source tools such as [RandAugment3D](https://github.com/JulianKlug/RandAugment-3D)
